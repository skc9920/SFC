# Scientific Calculator (SFC)

A feature-rich scientific calculator built in Java that supports basic arithmetic, advanced scientific functions, and a graphical user interface (GUI). This application provides users with an intuitive interface for performing complex mathematical calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Scientific Functions**: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `log`, `ln`, `sqrt`, `exp`
- **Memory Functions**: Store and recall values
- **Error Handling**: Handles divide by zero and invalid input
- **Parentheses Support**: Allows for grouping and evaluating complex expressions
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with Java Swing for a user-friendly experience

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skc9920/SFC.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd SFC
```

### 2. Compile and Run

If you are using a Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse), simply open the project and run it.

For command-line users:

1. Compile the Java source files:

   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java
   ```

2. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java Calculator
   ```

## Usage

Once the program is launched, you will be presented with a GUI that includes buttons for digits, operations, and advanced scientific functions. Here's how you can use it:

- **Basic Operations**: Click on the respective buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Functions**: Use the scientific function buttons (e.g., `sin`, `log`, `sqrt`, etc.) to calculate trigonometric, logarithmic, and other advanced functions.
- **Memory**: Store intermediate results using memory functions and recall them as needed.
- **Parentheses**: Use parentheses for more complex expressions.

### Example Usage

- **Trigonometry**: `sin(45)` → Calculates the sine of 45 degrees.
- **Logarithms**: `log(100)` → Calculates the base-10 logarithm of 100.
- **Exponentiation**: `exp(2)` → Returns the exponential of 2.
- **Complex Expression**: `(3 + 5) * 2` → Calculates the result of the expression inside parentheses.

## Code Overview

- **Calculator.java**: The main class that contains the logic for the scientific calculations.
- **CalculatorGUI.java**: Manages the graphical user interface and user input.
- **MathFunctions.java**: A utility class that implements various mathematical functions such as trigonometric and logarithmic operations.
